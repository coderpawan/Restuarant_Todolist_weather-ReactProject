# Restuarant_Todolist_weather-ReactProject
This is a combination of 3 Apps i.e Restuarant,Todolist,Weather websites under a single project . Here I used components,
API's and Reacts hooks alongwith many other concepts which was a quite wonderful tasks. 
In order to extract all projects you just have to make that particular line out of comment in App.js file in master branch . I have set the default app to Restuarant website
